# pnp4nagios
 Nagios PNP Grafana API , an alternative version of https://github.com/lingej/pnp-metrics-api/raw/master/application/controller/api.php that works with older versions of Nagios core and PNP (0.4.x).
 This api was created to be used by the [sni-pnp-datasource](https://grafana.com/plugins/sni-pnp-datasource), which is a Grafana backend datasource using PNP4Nagios/PNP NPCD to access RRD files.
 Internally this api doensnÂ´t work like the lingej version because of the version of the rrdtool used (the latest version of the Nagios CentOS VM comes with rrdtool 1.3.8 installed), but it works very well :smile:


## Installation

 To install it, just get the latest version from the respository and save it inside the `/usr/local/nagios/share/pnp/` folder. No extra configuration is required.

`wget "https://github.com/Dudssource/pnp4nagios/raw/master/api.php" -O /usr/local/nagios/share/pnp/api.php`

To install and configure the Grafana datasource, check the [official](https://grafana.com/plugins/sni-pnp-datasource/installation) tutorial.
